# New York Subway Network
This is a small class project which was made in a Data Analytics class. It uses Data from this MTA [Data-Set](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/Subway-Stations/arq3-7z49)
In this Notebook the data is used to form a graph consisting of all the stations of the New York Subway. After forming a graph in Python, we can use graph theory to make some analysis.
This project can even be taken further to combine the stations ( nodes of the graph ) with the number of entrances/exits to make more analysis on the number of people taking the subway etc. However,this is not yet included in this notebook.
